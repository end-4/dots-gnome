## About versions
- Border: Colored borders of buttons
- Solid: Colored background colors of buttons
- OuterBorders: Colored text, whole bar border only (Least buggy btw)

## Problems
- All top bar elements on the right having the same color
- Text padding in Border and Solid variants aren't quite right
